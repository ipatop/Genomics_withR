# Data manipulation

## Objectives

After this section you should be able to:

1. Load, explore and manioulate data in R


## Introduction

One of the main uses of R is for data manipulation and plot. This is similar to what many of us do in any regular table editor as excel or google spread sheet. 

We will use the following packages. You can read in detail the manual of each of them.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Install packages
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("plyr")

#Load the package
library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")
library("plyr")
library(RColorBrewer)
library(car)

#Manuals
#vignette("dplyr")
#?ggplot2
#?plyr

```

## Load data

There are many ways to load data. In the following chapters we will use a diverse set of functions to read the data from files. Some of them are:

```
read.table() #general to any type of table
read.csv() #specific for comma sepparated tables
read.delim() #specific for tab delimited tables
```

Some of the important options of these function are:
```
read.table(file = "location/of/your/file.txt",sep = ".",header = T or F)
```
Where the separator can be a comma, dot, etc. You can see more details using: `?read.table`

In this case we will use data that is already available in R. The package [datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) provides a handful set of data to analyze. 

We will use the [ChickWeight](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/ChickWeight.html) dataset. This is data set of weight in chickens with age an different diet. 

This will allow us to visualize the data and to do some statistic tests.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Install the package
#install.packages("datasets")
# For a full list of these datasets, type library(help = "datasets")
# Load the library and dataset
library(datasets)
data(ChickWeight) #What happens in the Environment section of RStudio?
```

## Data exploration 

It is important to understand the data before heading into the analysis. We will go over some techniques for this.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# To see the table, you can click on the environment part or run this...
#View(ChickWeight)

# As you can see this is a table, just in case we want to convert it to a data.frame
ChickWeight<-as.data.frame(ChickWeight)
```

To see only the beginning, we can use the head function:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight)
```

>What is n doing?

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight,n = 20) 
```

> What is the structure of the data.frame?

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
str(ChickWeight) 
```

With the **$ operator** we can explore the columns
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
class(ChickWeight$weight)
```

We can see the **dimensions of the table** for example:  how many **rows** it has?
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
nrow(ChickWeight)
```
How many **columns**?
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ncol(ChickWeight)
```

The **names** of columns
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
names(ChickWeight)
```

With the **[]** we can access the individual elements
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
names(ChickWeight)[3]
```
We can see the levels of a factor
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
levels(ChickWeight$Diet)[1:3]
```
What is the difference if we just print the column?
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ChickWeight$Diet[1:3]
```

Can we see the levels of a numeric vector? This is a reminder that the data type is important.
```
levels(ChickWeight$weight) # nop
```

We can now get different basic statistics now:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mean(ChickWeight$weight)
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
summary(ChickWeight$weight)
```
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
summary(ChickWeight)
```

To see what is this exactly doing, just go to the help page:
`?summary`
 
To save this summary table we can create an object with just the result of the summary
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
chick_sumary<-summary(ChickWeight)
chick_sumary
```
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
class(chick_sumary)
```
We can change the data kind, and assign it to a different object
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
chick_sumary_df<-as.data.frame(chick_sumary)
```
This is not that useful as you can see if you inspect the data in using View(chick_sumary_df) this is because it is a complicated format, we better just save the table. 
We will see other ways to save data in R in the future chapters.
You can see more details using: `?write.table`

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
write.table(chick_sumary, "mydata.txt", sep="\t",row.names = F,col.names = T)
#this is clearly no perfect but for the important part, the numeric and integer columns, we have the stat
```

## Subsetting

Subsetting means extracting part of the data. There are many different ways to do this. One important notion for tables and data frames is that dimensions go as follows:
`data[row,column]`

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#we can see specific columns and rows
ChickWeight[1,1:3] #row 1, column 1:3
```
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ChickWeight[1:3,1] #col 1, row 1:3
```
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ChickWeight[1,1] #row1, col1
```
If we want to know for example only the data from the chickens taking the diet 4
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet==4,])
```
> Why == and no =?

Remeber in R, = is an assignment, as the <-, while the == is for comparison
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight$Diet==4)
```
and
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
class(ChickWeight$Diet==4)
```

So, when we do ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet==4,], R is just showing the ChickWeight for which ChickWeight$Diet==4 is TRUE
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(which(ChickWeight$Diet==4))
```
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet==4,])
```
and for more conditions:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet==4 & ChickWeight$Time>6,])
```
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet==4 & ChickWeight$Time>6 & ChickWeight$Time<20,])
```
And if I just want the weights of these...

```
ChickWeight$weight[ChickWeight$Diet==4 & ChickWeight$Time>6 & ChickWeight$Time<20,] 
```
>why this gives an error? 

because we only have one dimension now, no 2
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight$weight[ChickWeight$Diet==4 & ChickWeight$Time>6 & ChickWeight$Time<20])
```

## Activity: 

This activity integrates knowledge from the previous chapter.

**1. Remove the first and last row of the ChickWeight data frame**
**2. Create a vector with the second column from the data frame**


# Visualization and Statistical test

## Objectives

After this section you should be able to:

1. Plot and explore the data in many ways.
2. Do statistical tests on the data.

## Introduction

We will use the same data we already explored in last chapter. Remember: chickens weight, age (Time) for different diets.

There are many things we can explore in this data. Each question we might want to answer will be better addressed using different plots.
For example: 
1. If the chickens are older we expect them to be bigger. This can be visualized using a dotplot.
2. We might want to see the distribution of weight separated by diet. This can be addressed by a histogram.

`ggplot` is a very useful function that allows us to manipulate the colors, the plot type, etc. I know it can be difficult to understand it at the beginning but after a while it becomes really intuitive. Important things to consider:
1. We will be able to plot anything that is a column in the data matrix.
2. Everything is or can be a layer in the plot.
3. When you decide to color or shape by a factor that separates your data this will impact the plot.

## Plots

Columns we can plot:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Point and line plots"}
names(ChickWeight)
```
### Line and points
Dot plot with basic qplot (from ggplot but les complex)
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Point and line plots"}
qplot(data=ChickWeight,x = weight, y=Time, geom = c("line","point"))
qplot(data=ChickWeight,x = weight, y=Time, geom = c("line","point"), colour=Diet) #adding the color helps to separate the data
```
The same using ggplot
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Point and line plots"}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(y = weight, x=Time,colour=Diet))+ #data and basic things about the plot
  geom_point() + #add the type of plot
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") #add a colot pallet

ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(y = weight, x=Time,colour=Diet))+ #data and basic things about the plot
  geom_point() + #add the type of plot
  geom_smooth() + #add a trend line of mean plus se
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")

```
### Historgam and density plots

Histograms are used to represent the distribution of a variable over the population. If you want to read more you can go to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram). Other way to represent the same thing is to use cumulative plots we are not going to explore them now but if you are interested in doing them with ggplot you can go to this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15844919/cumulative-plot-using-ggplot2)

[Density plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation) are similar to histograms but implies a more complex treatment of the data. They look like smooth histogram. They are the probability density function of the variable.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Histogram and Density plots"}
qplot(data = ChickWeight,x=weight, binwith=10)
qplot(data = ChickWeight,x=weight, binwith=10, colour=Diet) #the color separates the data
qplot(data = ChickWeight,x=weight, geom = "density", colour=Diet)
```
With ggplot
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Point and line plots"}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x=weight,color=Diet))+
  geom_histogram(fill="white", alpha=0.5, position="identity")+
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")

ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x=weight,fill=Diet))+
  geom_density( alpha=0.5)+
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```
### Boxplot

Boxplots are a nice way to visualize the data distribution and to get and intuition of how this is different between conditions. As you can see in this figure, it summarizes a LOT of information:

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE,fig.align="center",fig.cap="Boxplot description. Figrue affapted from https://www.simplypsychology.org/boxplots.html"}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, fig.align="center")
knitr::include_graphics("./images/boxplot.jpg")
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Boxplot"}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(y=weight,x=as.factor(Time),fill=Diet))+ #Note how the x, y and color changes
  geom_boxplot()+ #this is adding the  boxplot
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

What happens if we do not use the `as.factor`? Again, a reminder that the data type is important!

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Boxplot"}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(y=weight,x=Time,fill=Diet))+ #Note how the x, y and color changes
  geom_boxplot()+ #this is adding the  boxplot
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

It seems interesting to separate this by age (Time). This is achieved by another layer named facet.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Plot sepparating by age of the chicken"}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x=weight,fill=Diet))+
  geom_density( alpha=0.5)+
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")+
  facet_wrap(~Time,scales = "free")

ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(y=weight,x=as.factor(Time),fill=Diet))+
  geom_boxplot()+scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")+
  facet_wrap(~Time,scales = "free")

ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(y=weight,x=as.factor(Time),fill=Diet))+
  geom_violin()+
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")+
  facet_wrap(~Time,scales = "free")

```

## Statistical test

### Descriptive statistics

We already saw a way to get the descriptive stats from a table by using `summary`.

We will try to compare the weight of chickens under different diets without taking into account the age. 

First, we will now do a mean and SD table for each diet. There is one function that can do this for us.
`ddply` is a function that first divides the data by a variable written as .(Var) and then perform an specific function. With the indication of "transform" this will create a new column in out data

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Boxplot"}
stat_ChickWeight<-ddply(ChickWeight,  .(Diet),  transform,  Mean=mean(weight,na.rm = T), SD=sd(weight,na.rm = T))

head(stat_ChickWeight)
```

> Is this what we wanted?
What happens if instead of "transform" we use "summarize"? Check `?ddply` for more detail.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Boxplot"}
statWeight_ChickWeight<-ddply(ChickWeight,  .(Diet),  summarise,  Mean=mean(weight,na.rm = T), SD=sd(weight,na.rm = T))

head(statWeight_ChickWeight)
```
This is usefull for ploting, here a good plot:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.cap="Boxplot"}
ggplot(statWeight_ChickWeight, aes(x=Diet, y=Mean, fill=Diet)) + 
   geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=Mean-SD, ymax=Mean+SD), width=.2,
                 position=position_dodge(.9))
```

## T-test/Wilcoxon

To compare means we can do a T test but to do this we need to test the assumptions of this test: **Normality** of the data and Homoscedasticity (ie, the variance is similar between the two groups we want to compare)

*Question* : Is there any significant difference in the weights between diet 1 and 3?
Preliminary test to check independent t-test assumptions

*Assumption 1*: Are the two samples independents?
Yes, they are two different samples

*Assumption 2*: Are the data from each of the 2 groups follow a normal distribution?

Shapiro-Wilk normality test for the different diets

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
shapiro.test(ChickWeight$weight[ChickWeight$Diet==1])
```

The function with allows us to do a simpler writing
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
with(ChickWeight, shapiro.test(weight[Diet == 1]))
```
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
with(ChickWeight, shapiro.test(weight[Diet == 2]))
```

pvalue < 0.05, these are not normally distributed. We can NOT use t-test here. If we remember the histograms, this makes sense.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
qplot(data=ChickWeight, x = weight, facets = "Diet",geom = "density")
```

*Assumption 3*: Do the two populations have the same variances?

We’ll use F-test to test for homogeneity in variances. This is implemented by a function named `var.test`. This will require you to have which variable you want to test and separated by which variable. 
This is clearly also not homoscedastic.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
var.test(weight~ Diet, data = ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet %in% c(1,2),])
```
> What happens if you try to run this `var.test(weight~ Diet, data = ChickWeight)`?

We will use then Wilcoxon.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wilcox.test(weight~ Diet, data = ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet %in% c(1,2),],exact = FALSE)
```

> Are them different?

### Anova/Kruskal–Wallis 

Another way to test differences is to do an [ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) or its non-parametric alternative [Kruskal–Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal–Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance). We already know that this data cannot be analyzed using parametric test as anova. But let’s explore just for fun.

Let’s check all the diets together
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Compute the analysis of variance
res.aov <- aov(weight~ Diet, data = ChickWeight)
# Summary of the analysis
summary(res.aov)
```

We see that the diet is a significant component of the variance of the data. Now we should know from where it is coming. We need to do a multiple pairwise-comparison. We will use Tukey Honest Significant Difference for this.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
TukeyHSD(res.aov)
```

However, you should be screaming at me now: I did not check the assumptions!

1. *Homogeneity of variances*:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(res.aov, 1)
```


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
leveneTest(weight~ Diet, data = ChickWeight)
```
We have just found what we already know. The variance is not homogeneous. The variance across groups is statistically significantly different.


2. *Normality of the residuals*:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(res.aov, 2)
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Extract the residuals
aov_residuals <- residuals(object = res.aov )
# Run Shapiro-Wilk test
shapiro.test(x = aov_residuals )
```

Non parametric then:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
kruskal.test(weight~ Diet, data = ChickWeight)
```

> What would you conclude about this data?
