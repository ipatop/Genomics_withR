# Sequencing techniques and preprocesing

## Objectives

After this section you should be able to:

1. Have an overview of different sequencing techniques and different genomic data
2. Understand the preprocesing of the data before loading it into R

## Introduction

Large scale sequencing techniques become 

## Different type of data (DNA, RNA, splicing)

## From The sequencer machine to the sequence

BaseCalls Fastq and FastQC files 

## Alignemet (bam files, annotation files, BOWTIE2 and STAR)

## Gene counts / read (feature counts)
## Alignement
