# Overview {-}

The idea of the practical part will be to give you tools to be able to manage regular data-analysis in molecular biology labs. Also we think that this training in basic programing and statistics will be of high value for your future projects.

## Course Aims

* Learn basic coding intuition and usage of R for analysis and plots.
* Undestand the main issues we have to deal with in Genomics.
* Learn how to do basic analysis, Chipseq, RNAseq, SingleCell.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to:

* Create your own R code.
* Do basic and complex analysis.
* Read and understand R code.

## Next steps

I have a project on shell commands for biologist. Will be available soon.

## Data availability

All the data used in this book is publiclily available. Preprocessed files can be found in this [reposotory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AU01lWjAuXP0Ln4jNM0anWC2SAfbN6Oq?usp=sharing)
