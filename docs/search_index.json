For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00 1.1 Including Plots You can also embed plots, for example: Figure 1.1: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. "]
